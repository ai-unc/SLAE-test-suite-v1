Zeng_2022_Evaluating the public health impact of partial and ful,"In the full ban scenario, there is an Full ban Immediate effect: Most flavoured users switch to unflavoured cigarettes immediately, with a smaller number quitting and an even smaller number continuing to illicitly smoke flavoured cigarettes. Long-term effect: There are no changes to quitting and relapse rates for unflavoured cigarettes. It is assumed that relapse to flavoured tobacco no longer happens; nor do transitions from unflavoured to flavoured. A proportion of new smokers who would have smoked flav?oured tobacco is assumed to initiate unflavoured instead, and a small proportion is assumed to initiate flavoured tobacco illicitly. It is assumed that a small fraction of those who remain or become flavoured tobacco users despite the ban give up and switch to unflavoured each year. Sensitivity analyses: We explored different levels of the proportion initiating banned flavours, initiating unflavoured in lieu of flavoured tobacco, and switching from flavoured to unflavoured users. Partial ban Immediate effect: A fraction of flavoured users switch to unflavoured cigarettes immediately, with the rest continuing to smoke the permit?ted flavours. A smaller number quit. Long-term effect: There are no changes to quitting and relapse rates for unflavoured cigarettes, and no change in quitting rates for flavoured. It is assumed that initiation rates of unflavoured cigarettes is a bit higher and of flavoured cigarettes is a bit lower in the presence of the ban. It is also assumed that fewer people transition to flavoured users from unflavoured state; and that relapse rates are lower too. Sensitivity analyses: We explored different levels of the proportion initiating banned flavours, initiating unflavoured in lieu of flavoured tobacco, and switching from unflavoured, or ex-smokers, to current flavoured users.
