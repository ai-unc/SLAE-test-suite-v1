Schwartz_2017_Tobacco industry tactics in preparing for menthol ,"Eight capsule brands had wording ??denoting choice. Examples are: ‘Fresh ??taste at your fingertips’, ‘Boost your ??menthol taste. It is your choice’, ‘choose to ??refresh your taste’, ‘create your refreshing ??taste experience’. Other common themes, ??included: smooth, fresh, refreshing and ??crisp. The capsule brands also depicted ??an image of a ‘power on’ button, some?times in icy/silvery colour. One had two ??‘power on’ buttons—green and blue. A ??previous study suggested that the power ??button may depict technology as relating ??to the crushable filter.3 We hypothesise ??that capsules were introduced to expose ??menthol smokers to the taste of non?men?thol cigarettes and possibly to alternative ??technologies for choice to add flavour or ??coolant sensation.","Impending menthol cigarette ban

Zeng_2022_Evaluating the public health impact of partial and ful,"In the full ban scenario, there is an Full ban Immediate effect: Most flavoured users switch to unflavoured cigarettes immediately, with a smaller number quitting and an even smaller number continuing to illicitly smoke flavoured cigarettes. Long-term effect: There are no changes to quitting and relapse rates for unflavoured cigarettes. It is assumed that relapse to flavoured tobacco no longer happens; nor do transitions from unflavoured to flavoured. A proportion of new smokers who would have smoked flav?oured tobacco is assumed to initiate unflavoured instead, and a small proportion is assumed to initiate flavoured tobacco illicitly. It is assumed that a small fraction of those who remain or become flavoured tobacco users despite the ban ‘give up’ and switch to unflavoured each year. Sensitivity analyses: We explored different levels of the proportion initiating banned flavours, initiating unflavoured in lieu of flavoured tobacco, and switching from flavoured to unflavoured users. Partial ban Immediate effect: A fraction of flavoured users switch to unflavoured cigarettes immediately, with the rest continuing to smoke the permit?ted flavours. A smaller number quit. Long-term effect: There are no changes to quitting and relapse rates for unflavoured cigarettes, and no change in quitting rates for flavoured. It is assumed that initiation rates of unflavoured cigarettes is a bit higher and of flavoured cigarettes is a bit lower in the presence of the ban. It is also assumed that fewer people transition to flavoured users from unflavoured state; and that relapse rates are lower too. Sensitivity analyses: We explored different levels of the proportion initiating banned flavours, initiating unflavoured in lieu of flavoured tobacco, and switching from unflavoured, or ex-smokers, to current flavoured users.
